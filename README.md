# CO2-Intensity-of-Electricity-Generation-Analysis-using-Artificial-Neural-Network-
This algorithm consists of two parts in which the first part predicts the amount of co2 generated form the European countries and the second part would predict the co2 generated in the respective years  based on the dataset , all this is done using Artificial Neural Network (Deep Learning) Framework
